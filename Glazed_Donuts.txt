Recipe: Glazed Donuts
Ingredients:
DONUT
1 1/2 cups milk, warm to the touch
1 cup sugar
1/2 oz yeast
1 stick unsalted butter, soft
3 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
5 cups flour, sifted
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
shortening, for frying
GLAZE
3 cups powdered sugar
1 cup dry milk powder
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup water, hot
Directions:
1. In a medium bowl, add the milk, sugar, and yeast, stirring to combine.
2. In a separate medium bowl, add the butter, eggs, and vanilla extract, stirring to combine.
3. Add the milk mixture to the egg mixture and whisk to combine. Transfer to a large bowl and add the flour in thirds, stirring between each addition.
4. Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes, until smooth. Gently poke the dough with a finger--the dough should bounce back up from the indentation.
5. Place the dough in a large bowl, and lightly coat the dough with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.
6. Let the dough rise in a warm place for an hour, or until doubled in size.
7. Take the dough out and knead on a floured surface for 5 minutes until smooth. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and repeat with rise overnight in refrigerator.
8. Roll out the dough on a floured surface until ¼ inch (6 mm) thick.
9. Cut out the doughnuts and donut holes with a cookie cutter and piping tip.
10. Melt enough shortening over medium heat to come up just 2 inches (5 cm) up on the side of a heavy frying pan. Heat the shortening to 375°F (190°C)
11. Fry the donuts and donut holes for 45 seconds on each side, or until golden brown.
12. In a bowl, combine the powdered sugar, dry milk powder, vanilla extract and hot water until smooth.
13. Strain the glaze through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps.
14. Dunk the donuts in the glaze or drizzle the glaze on top.
