Recipe: Pork Posole
Ingredients:
3 dried guajillo chile peppers, stemmed and seeded
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 10-ounce bone-in smoked pork chops, diced (bones reserved)
1 white onion, diced, plus more for topping
5 cloves garlic, chopped
1 bay leaf
1 tablespoon dried oregano (preferably Mexican)
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2 15-ounce cans white hominy, drained and rinsed
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
Sliced radishes and fresh cilantro, for topping
Lime wedges, for serving
Directions:
Heat a medium saucepan over high heat until very hot, about 1 minute. Add the chiles and cook, pressing them down with a spatula, until browned in spots, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup chicken broth and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and set aside.

Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over high heat. Add the pork chop bones and cook, turning, until lightly browned on both sides, about 2 minutes. Add the onion, garlic and bay leaf and cook, stirring, until the onion is softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in the oregano and cumin and cook for 30 seconds. Add the remaining 3 cups of chicken broth and the hominy. Cover and bring to a simmer.

Puree the chile-broth mixture in a blender until smooth; add to the pot. Continue to simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Discard the pork bones and bay leaf. Add the diced pork and cook until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Top each serving with diced onion, sliced radishes and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.
