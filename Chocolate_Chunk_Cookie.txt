Recipe: Chocolate Chunk Cookie
Ingredients:
1/2 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar, packed
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks
4 oz dark chocolate chunk, or your preference
Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps. Then, whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.
Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula, then fold in the chocolate chunks and chill the dough for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Leave at least 4 inches of space between cookies and 2 inches of space from the edges of the pan.
Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown. Cool before serving
